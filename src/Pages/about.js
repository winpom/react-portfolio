        <h2>Software Engineer, Marketer, Lifelong Student</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Win Pomerantz, a marketer turned aspiring web developer. With over seven years
            of experience in brand and digital marketing at companies like Charles Schwab, Ubisoft, and eBay, I've
            developed a strong understanding of the customer, enabling me to better craft engaging narratives and user experiences.
            With a bachelors degree from Emory University and MBA from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business,
            I'm currently diving into the world of coding through the full-time UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp.
            I'm passionate about blending creativity with technical skills to build captivating web experiences.
        </p>
        <p> Join me as I transition from marketing to coding and explore the exciting intersection of art and technology! </p>
